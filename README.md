Lightning Bitcoin Core 
=====================================


What is Lightning Bitcoin?
----------------

Lightning Bitcoin (LBTC) is a fully decentralized Internet-of-value protocol for global payments. The specific applications include peer-to-peer transactions and exchange platforms. Any users that participate in the LBTC protocol can enjoy instant, secure and nearly free global financial transactions of any size. 

Lightning Bitcoinâ€™s on-chain governance system enables LBTC holders to vote for the blockchain improvement proposals and the delegates who maintain the network as Lightning Nodes. It solves the problems of centralization of bitcoin by incorporating all participants in the Lightning Bitcoin ecosystem into the decision-making process.

Lightning Bitcoin is forked from [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoin.org/). And the official implementation of Lightning Bitcoin full node replaces PoW consensus of Bitcoin with DPoS, it means LBTC fully meets bitcoin standard except for consensus algorithm.

However, here are these differences:
* DPoS
* Replay Protection
* Transaction extention (Register/Vote/CancelVote)
